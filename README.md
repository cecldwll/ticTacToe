# ticTacToe

## Overview

In this project, I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ to build my skills as a software engineer and practice working with fundamental coding concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays. This program lets a player compete against the computer in a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing me to better understand C++ syntax and structure.

The purpose of writing this software was to reinforce my knowledge of C++ basics, like handling user input, using arrays to represent game states, and creating simple game logic. This project helped me practice breaking down larger tasks into manageable functions, making the code more organized and easier to understand.

## Development Environment

I developed this software using Visual Studio as my code editor, with a basic setup for compiling C++ code. The language used is C++, and I included the `iostream` library for input/output and `ctime` for generating random numbers for the computer’s moves.

## Useful Websites

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/) - A helpful resource for understanding C++ syntax and library functions.
- [GeeksforGeeks C++ Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/) - Provided examples and explanations of core C++ concepts.
- [Microsoft Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/creating-and-managing-visual-cpp-projects?view=msvc-170) - Helped me finally set up my code in an editor.

## Future Work

- Improve the AI logic to make the computer’s moves more challenging.
- Add error handling to prevent invalid input from crashing the game.
- Create a graphical version to make the game more visually engaging.
